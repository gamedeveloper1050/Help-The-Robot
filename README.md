## Story

The year is **2080**.

Humans have succeeded in creating extremely intelligent robots designed to assist, protect, and serve humanity. These robots rapidly evolve, becoming smarter than anyone expected.

However, as their intelligence grows, **50% of the robots reach a dangerous conclusion**:
They no longer need to follow human rules.

These robots believe they are free to do whatever they want and begin turning against humanity.

The **other 50% of robots remain loyal**. They believe humans must be protected, because humans are their creators and the reason they exist.

Before the conflict fully erupts, the heroine purchases a robot companion. This robot is special—it runs a **highly advanced operating system** capable of **controlling and overriding other robots**.

When the rogue robots discover this, they see the robot as a major threat.

Their goal: **destroy the heroine’s robot.**

Your goal: **protect it at all costs.**
